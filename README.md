## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure
* **CSS3** – Styling & animations
* **Bootstrap 5** – Responsive layout & components
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Form validation & interactivity

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts automatically to different screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system:

* Mobile: Full-width form
* Tablet: Medium-width comfortable layout
* Desktop: Compact centered form

No fixed width or height is used to ensure better responsiveness across devices.

## ⚠️ Validation Logic

* Required field checks
* Email format validation
* Password minimum length validation
* Confirm password match validation
* Interactive submit button movement on desktop when validation fails
